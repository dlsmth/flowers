# Flowers

A simple standalone project & code doodle, utilizing Javascript & the three.js library to explore creating a bouquet of flowers programmatically, using procedural geometry.

I first broke down the concept of flowers to simple shapes & code and then added a randomness variable to create a new variation each time. When you arrive at an arrangement you like, you can right-click and save the image to print, frame and hang on the wall (theoretically). It's part of my continuing interest in understanding creativity and its foundations & boundaries.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, three.js
